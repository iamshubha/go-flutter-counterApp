# go-flutter-counterApp


## Getting started

The best way to get started is to install [hover](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/hover), the official go-flutter tool to set up, build and run Flutter apps on the desktop, including hot-reload.

Read the [hover tutorial](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/hover) to run your app on the desktop, or start with [one of our example apps](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/examples).

If you want more in-depth information about go-flutter, read the [wiki](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter/wiki).
